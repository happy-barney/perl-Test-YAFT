=head1 NAME

Test::YAFT - Yet another testing framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Test::YAFT;

	it q (should pass this test)
		=> got    => scalar do { ... }
		=> expect => $expected_value
		;

=head1 DISCLAIMER

Please accept the fact that I'm not English native speaker so this documentation
may contain improper grammar or wording making it harder to understand.

If you encounter such place, please visit project's issue tracking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module combines features of multiple test libraries providing
its own, BDD inspired, Context oriented, testing approach.

=head1 GLOSSARY

=over

=item assert

Assumption function performs actual value comparison.

=item expectation

Expectation function provides object (L<Test::Deep::Cmp>) describing
expected value.

=item foundation

Foundation functions are used to build higher level assumptions, expectations, and/or tools.

=back

=head1 Test::YAFT AND OTHER LIBRARIES

Please read following documentation how are other test libraries
mapped into L<Test::YAFT> workflow.

=over

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Deep>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Exception>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::More>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Spec>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Warnings>

=head1 EXPORTED SYMBOLS

This module exports symbols using L<Exporter::Tiny>.

=head2 Asserts

	use Test::YAFT qw (:assumptions);

Assumption functions are exported by default.

Every assumption accepts (if any) test message as a first (positional) parameter,
with restof parameters using named approach.

When assumption performs multiple expectations internally, it always reports
as one, using provided test message, failing early.

Named parameters are provided either via key/value pairs

	ok q (test title)
		=> got => $value
		;

or via builder functions

	ok q (test title)
		=> got { build got }
		;

Coding style note: I suggest to use coding style as presented in all examples,
with one parameter per line, leading with fat comma.

=head3 assume

	assume q (meaningful sentence)
		=> got    => ...
		=> expect => ...
		;

For more details see L</it>

=head3 fail

	return fail q (what failed);
	return fail q (what failed)
		=> diag => q (diagnostic message)
		;
	return fail q (what failed)
		=> diag => sub { q (diagnostic message) }
		;

Likewise L<Test::More/fail> it also always fails, but it also accepts
additional parameter - diagnostic message to show.

When diagnostic message is a CODEREF, it is executed and its result is treated
as list of diagnostic messages (passed to C<diag>)

=head3 had_no_warnings

	had_no_warnings;
	had_no_warnings q (title);

Reexported from L<Test::Warnings>

=head3 it

	it q (should be ...)
		=> got    => ...
		=> expect => ...
		;

Basic test primitive, used by all other test functions.
It uses L<Test::Deep>'s C<cmp_deeply> to compare values.

In addition to C<Test::Deep>'s stack also uses L<Test::Difference> to report
differences when failed.

When expected value is L<Test::Deep::Bool> then it uses L<Test::More>'s C<ok>.

Accepted named(-like) parameters:

=over

=item arrange

	it q (should ...)
		=> arrange { foo => q (bar) }
		=> arrange { bar => q (baz) }
		;

C<arrange { }> blocks are evaluated in context of C<it>-local frame
before resolving value under test (C<got { }>).

C<arrange { }> blocks are always evaluated, even when value under test
is provided as an exact value.

=item diag

Custom diagnostic message, printed out in case of failure.

When specified no other diagnostic message is printed.

Can be string, arrayref of strings, or coderef returning strings.

Coderef gets two parameters - Test::Deep stack and value under test.

=item expect

Expected value.

When specified and C<got { }> block is used, additional expectation that it
didn't die is executed before any other comparison.

=item got

Value under test.

When C<got { }> block is used, it is evaluated and its error status is checked
before actual comparison.

=item throws

Expected error.

When specified and C<got { }> block is used, additional expectation that it
did die is executed before any other comparison.

When both C<expect> and C<throws> parameters are specified, C<throws> takes precedence.

See also L<Test::YAFT::Test::Exception>.

=head3 nok

	nok q (shouldn't be ...)
		=> got    => ...
		;

Simple shortcut to expect value behaving like boolean false.

=head3 ok

	ok q (should be ...)
		=> got    => ...
		;

Utility functions are exported by default.

Functions helping to organize your tests.

=head3 BAIL_OUT

=head3 arrange

	arrange { foo => q (bar) };

	it q (should ...)
		=> arrange { foo => q (bar2) }
		=> got { $foo->method (deduce q (foo)) }
		=> expect => ...
		;

Arrange block is treated as a function providing arguments for L<Context::Singleton>'s
C<proclaim>.

Arrange block returns a guard object, which is evaluated in frame valid at the
time of evaluation (timely evaluation is responsibility of C<it>).

When C<arrange { }> is called in void context, it is evaluated immediately.

Validity of values follows L<Context::Singleton> rules, so for example

	# This is available globally
	arrange { foo => q (global value) };

	subtest q (subtest) => sub {
		# This is available in scope of subtest (it creates its own frame)
		arrange { foo => q (subtest local) };

		# This is available only in scope of 'it' (ie, insite got { })
		it q (should ...)
			=> got { ... }
			=> arrange { foo => q (assumption local) }
			;
	};

=head3 diag

Reexported L<Test::More/diag>

=head3 done_testing

Reexported L<Test::More/done_testing>

=head3 explain

Reexported L<Test::More/explain>

=head3 got

Can be used to specify code to build test value or to test that given code
should / shouldn't throw an exception.

	it q (should die)
		=> got { $foo->do_something }
		=> throws => expect_obj_isa (...)
		;

When used, C<it> always checks error status first before checking provided
expectations.

Reexported L<Test::More/plan>

=head3 skip

Reexported L<Test::More/skip>

=head3 subtest

frame for each subtest.

Reexported L<Test::More/todo>

=head3 todo_skip

Reexported L<Test::More/todo_skip>

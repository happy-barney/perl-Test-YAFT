=head1 NAME

Test::YAFT - Yet another testing framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module combines features of multiple test libraries providing
its own, BDD inspired, Context oriented, testing approach.

=head1 GLOSSARY

=over

=item assert

Assert function performs actual value comparison.

=item expectation

Expectation function provides object (L<Test::Deep::Cmp>) describing
expected value.

=item plumbing

Similar concept to git, plumbing functions are used to build
higher level asserts, expectations, and/or tools.

=back

=head1 Test::YAFT AND OTHER LIBRARIES

Please read following documentation how are other test libraries
mapped into L<Test::YAFT> workflow.

=over

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Deep>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Exception>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::More>

=item L<Test::YAFT::Test::Warnings>

=back

=head1 EXPORTED SYMBOLS

This module exports symbols using L<Exporter::Tiny>.

=head2 Asserts

	use Test::YAFT qw[ :asserts ];

Assert functions are exported by default.

Every assert accepts (if any) test message as a first (positional) parameter,
with restof parameters using named approach.

When assert performs multiple expectations internally, it always reports
as one, using provided test message, failing early.

Named parameters are provided either via key/value pairs

	ok "test title"
		=> got => $value
		;

or via builder functions

	ok "test title"
		=> got { build got }
		;

Coding style note: I suggest to use coding style as presented in all examples,
with one parameter per line, leading with fat comma.

=head3 fail

	return fail 'what failed';
	return fail 'what failed'
		=> diag => "diagnostic message"
		;
	return fail 'what failed'
		=> diag => sub { "diagnostic message" }
		;

Likewise L<Test::More/fail> it also always fails, but it also accepts
additional parameter - diagnostic message to show.

When diagnostic message is a CODEREF, it is executed and its result is treated
as list of diagnostic messages (passed to C<diag>)

=head3 had_no_warnings

	had_no_warnings;
	had_no_warnings 'title';

Reexported from L<Test::Warnings>

=head3 it

	it "should be ..."
		=> got    => ...
		=> expect => ...
		;

Basic test primitive, used by all other test functions.
It uses L<Test::Deep>'s C<cmp_deeply> to compare values.

In addition to C<Test::Deep>'s stack also uses L<Test::Difference> to report
differences when failed.

When expected value is L<Test::Deep::Bool> then it uses L<Test::More>'s C<ok>.

Accepted named(-like) parameters:

=over

=item diag

Custom diagnostic message, printed out in case of failure.

When specified no other diagnostic message is printed.

Can be string, arrayref of strings, or coderef returning strings.

Coderef gets two parameters - Test::Deep stack and value under test.

=item expect

Expected value.

When specified and C<got { }> block is used, additional expectation that it
didn't die is executed before any other comparison.

=item got

Value under test.

When C<got { }> block is used, it is evaluated and its error status is checked
before actual comparison.

=item throws

Expected error.

When specified and C<got { }> block is used, additional expectation that it
did die is executed before any other comparison.

When both C<expect> and C<throws> parameters are specified, C<throws> takes precedence.

See also L<Test::YAFT::Test::Exception>.

=back

=head3 nok

	nok "shouldn't be ..."
		=> got    => ...
		;

Simple shortcut to expect value behaving like boolean false.

=head3 ok

	ok "should be ..."
		=> got    => ...
		;


Simple shortcut to expect value behaving like boolean true.

=head3 pass

	pass 'what passed';

Reexported from L<Test::More>

	there "should be ..."
		=> got    => ...
		=> expect => ...
		;

Alias for C<it>, providing convenient word to form meaningful English sentence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

its own, BDD inspired, Context oriented, testing approach.

=head1 GLOSSARY

=over

=back

=head1 EXPORTED SYMBOLS

This module exports symbols using L<Exporter::Tiny>.

=head2 Asserts

Every assert accepts (if any) test message as a first (positional) parameter,
with restof parameters using named approach.

When assert performs multiple expectations internally, it always reports
as one, using provided test message, failing early.

Named parameters are provided either via key/value pairs

	ok "test title"
		=> got => $value
		;

or via builder functions

	ok "test title"
		=> got { build got }
		;

Coding style note: I suggest to use coding style as presented in all examples,
with one parameter per line, leading with fat comma.

=head2 Helper Functions

Functions helping to organize your tests.

=head2 Utility Functions

Functions helping writing your custom asserts and/or expectations.

=head1 NAME

Test::YAFT::Test::Deep::Cmp - Intermediate class for single param comparators

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package My::Comparator {
		use parent qw[ Test::YAFT::Test::Deep::Cmp ];

		sub descend {
			my ($self, $got) = @_;

			return $self->_val eq $got;
		}
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most of C<Test::Deep> comparators uses only single expected value so
little bit of abstraction saves few lines of code.

=head2 Constructor

	Comparator->new ('Foo')

=head2 Methods

=head3 _val

Returns expected value provided earlier to constructor

=head3 _render_value

Provides additional abstraction to rendering value allowing also C<$got> transformations.

In comparison to default L<Test::Deep::Cmp> implementation this approach allows
to write context expectations.
